## ❌ What Didn't Work

### 🚫 Issues Encountered

1. **Next.js Frontend**
   - ❌ Next.js dependencies corrupted (`next: not found`)
   - ❌ Turbopack compilation errors
   - ❌ Missing font files and build manifests
   - ❌ Permission issues with node_modules
   - **Solution**: Used simple HTML frontend instead

2. **Original Backend Validation**
   - ❌ Simple regex validation (`/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]+$/`) was incorrect
   - ❌ Didn't properly validate Midnight addresses
   - ❌ Missing proper error handling
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper Midnight wallet validation

3. **Dependency Management**
   - ❌ npm install issues with corrupted packages
   - ❌ Permission errors during package installation
   - ❌ Missing Next.js binaries
   - **Solution**: Used alternative deployment methods

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Valid Addresses
- ✅ `midnight1abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz` → Verified
- ✅ `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678` → Verified

### Invalid Addresses
- ❌ `invalid` → Not Verified (proper error message)
- ❌ `short` → Not Verified (proper error message)

## 🚀 How to Run
